    <h2>All courses</h2>

    <p>Even with the advances in science and technology, many people lagged behind and were not able to cope with the pace of growth in many places around the world. Most were unaware of the benefits of online education or of the existence of online classes in various countries. Just like every coin has two sides, there are two sides to online classes as well. Online classes are beneficial to continue our education despite various barriers. But online activities have the chance to digress into other addictive online activities at times when it comes to kids. Excess of anything is dangerous; therefore, investing too much time can harm the kids. Thus, parents should be responsible enough to take care of their children during online classes.</p>

        <p>The words nature and natural are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans. The word comes from the Latin natura meaning "birth". Nature includes many things like weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies. Scientists study the way the parts of nature work. Things that have been made by people are said to be man-made or called artifacts.
            There are natural sciences that study different parts of nature, for example the science of ecology is about plants and animals as a whole, while biology studies every type of living thing.
            From one point of view, humans are a prime example of nature, and are the most widely studied natural inhabitants of the planet earth. Humans interact with each other in their natural environment on a day-to-day basis. Every part of nature – everything from the air outside to the dirt on the ground – is interdependent. Medicine studies humans in health and sickness.
            From another point of view, humans and nature can be said to be in conflict. People always use natural resources. They cut down trees, mine ores, grow crops and manufacture things from natural material. Fires, cars, and factories make a lot of smoke and harm many places. People who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do. In the modern world, with many more people and many big cities, these problems are becoming more serious.
            Nature, in the broadest sense, means the physical world as a whole. This is the meaning that physics, the study of nature (etymologically), takes.
            A useful definition of natural is
            "Happening or operating in accordance with the ordinary course of nature". Oxford Shorter English Dictionary says the word in this sense is first found in 1477.</p>
